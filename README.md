Twot is a CLI tool to help with managing your Twitter experience by giving you advanced tools to manage who you follow, and who follows you.

Please read the [wiki](/rmaclean/twot/wiki) for details on how to configure and details on all the options.

_Note:_ This is really beta at this stage. Log an [incident](https://github.com/rmaclean/twot/issues) if you find issues.

## Commands

The following commands are available:
- [Ready](/rmaclean/twot/wiki/Command:-Ready): This helps check the configuration for Twot
- [Init](/rmaclean/twot/wiki/Command:-Init): This helps setup config files for you
- [BlockTrain](/rmaclean/twot/wiki/Command:--BlockTrain): This blocks or mutes a Twitter user and all their followers
- [Clean](/rmaclean/twot/wiki/Command:-Clean): This kicks people from following you based on a score; useful to remove fake followers and bots
- [Score](/rmaclean/twot/wiki/Command:-Score): This is the same as clean but provides a report rather than taking action
- [Unblock](/rmaclean/twot/wiki/Command:-Unblock): This unblocks or unmutes an account. A single account can be provided, or a file with multiple accounts, or it can unblocked/unmute all accounts blocked/mutedd on your account.
